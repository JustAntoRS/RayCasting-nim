# RayCasting Nim

## Introduction 

This is a Nim implementation of the [RayCasting tutorial](https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html) made by Lode Vandevenne

## Actual State

At the moment the code available is a direct translation from the code available in the tutorial to Nim, in the near future I will continue the tutorial and improve the engine with more features

The goal is to made an engine I can use to create some games because I really like the aesthetic of RayCasting :)
